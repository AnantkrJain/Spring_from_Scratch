Running from the Command-Line :-

	When running from command line
		No need to have IDE open/running
		
	Since we are using Spring Boot, the server is embedded in our JAR file
		No need to have seperate server installed/running
		
	Spring Boot apps are self-contained.(JAR file = application code + server)
	
	Two options for running the application
		1.	Use java -jar [jarFileName]
			
		2.	Use spring boot maven plugin -    
				mvnw package | mvn package
				mvnw spring-boot:run | mvn spring-boot:run
				
					Since "spring-boot-maven-plugin" is already available in pom.xml, package your application and run it.


	Development Process :-
		
		1.	Exit the IDE
		2.	Package the app using mvnw package
		3.	Run app using 'java -jar [JarFileName]'
		4.	Run app using Spring Boot Maven plugin, mvnw spring-boot:run | mvn spring-boot:run

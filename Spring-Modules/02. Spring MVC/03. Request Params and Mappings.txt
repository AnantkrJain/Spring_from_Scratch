Binding Request Params :-

	1.	We want to create a new method to process form data.
	2.	Read the form data: student's name
	3.	Convert the name to upper case
	4.  Add the uppercase version to model
	
	Instead of using HttpServletRequest(Holds the HTML form data), Model classes(Container for HTML form data) and getParameter(to get field name of HTML form data) method, use @RequestParam annotation. Through this annotation, spring will read param from request and bind it to the variable. 
	
	Controller Request Mapping -
		
		1.	Serves as parent mapping for controller.
		2.	All request mappings on methods in the controller are relative
		3.	Similar to folder directory structures

Java Annotations :-

	1.	Special labels/markers added to Java class
	2.	Provide meta-data about class
	3.	Processed at compile-time or run-time for special processing
	
	#If you have 100 beans or 1000 beans, it will be very verbose to write each and every bean in config file. Annotation minimizes the XML configuration.
	
	#Spring will scan your java classes for @Component annotation and automatically register the beans in spring container.
	
	Development Process -
		1.	Enable component scanning in spring config file
		2. 	Add the @Component Annotation to your java class
		3. 	Retrieve bean from spring container.
		
		# If we don't provide any bean id, default bean id will be generated. Bean id will be the class name having first letter lower-case.

Spring Dependency Injection with Annotation and Autowiring -

	For dependency, Spring can use auto wiring. Spring will look for a class the matches the property; matches by type[class or interface]. Spring will inject it hence it is autowired.

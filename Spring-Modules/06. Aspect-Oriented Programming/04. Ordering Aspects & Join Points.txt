How to control the order of advices being applied?

Place advices in seperate Aspects
Control order on aspects using the @Order annotation
	Lower numbers have higher precedence
		Range: Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE
		Negative numbers are allowed
		Does not have to be consecutive
		
		If aspects have the exact same @Order annotation, then that part is undefined.

	1.	Place advices in seperate aspects

Advanced Mappings :-

	In the database, you most likely will have -
		1.	Multiple Tables
		2.	Relationship between tables
		
	Need to model this with Hibernate.
	
	Types -
		1.	One-to-One
		2.	One-to-Many, Many-to-One
		3.	Many-to-Many
		
	
	One-to-One Mappings :-
	
		An Instructor can have an instructor detail entity
		
	One-to-Many Mappings :-
		
		An instructor can have many courses.
		
	Many-to-Many Mappings :-
	
		A course can have many students.
		A student can have many mappings.

Database Concepts :-

	1. Primary Key and Foreign Key -
	
		Primary Key - identify a unique row in the table.
		
		Foreign Key -
			Link tables together
			a field in one table that refers to primary key in another table.
			
	2.	Cascade -
		
		You can cascade operations
		Apply the same operation to related entities
		
		If we delete an instructor, then we also have to delete instructor_detail.
		This is known as CASCADE_DELETE.
		
		# You can't use cascade delete in many-to-many mapping.
		
	3.	Fetch Types -
	
		Eager  will retrieve everything.
		Lazy will retrieve on request.
		
	4.  Uni-directional and Bi-directional -
		
		Uni-directional - Through Instructor, you can access instructor_detail but not vice-versa.

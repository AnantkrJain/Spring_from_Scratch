A course can have many students.
A student can have many courses.

	Need to track which student in which course and vice-versa.
	
	Join Table - A table that provides a mapping between two tables. It has foreign keys for each table to define the mapping relationship.
	@JoinTable tells Hibernate
		Look at the course_id column in the course_student table.
		For the other side(Inverse), look at the student_id column in the course_student table.
		Use the information to find the relationship between course and students.
		
		Inverse - 
			In this context, we are defining the relationship in Course class.
			The student class is on the other side, so it is considered the inverse.
			Inverse refers to the other side of relationship.
			
	If we delete the course, do not delete students.
	If we delete the students, do not delete the courses.
	
	Development Process -
		1.	Prep work - Define database tables
		2.	Update Course class
		3.	Update Student class
		4.	Create Main app
